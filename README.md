# Bevy Tower Defense Tutorial

This is a educational project showing how to create a simple [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game.
Follows the bevy tutorial series at [LogicProjects on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XfJaSqLPBM&list=PLT_D88-MTFOPPl75g4WshL1Gx2bnGTUkz&index=7).

The series covers everything including: cameras, spawning 3d models, UI, state management, ECS design, audio, plugins, and more.  It was designed to be a quick and easy intro into Bevy game development to get new users from 0 to creating a 3d game in around 1.5 hours.  I assume only basic Rust knowledge and no intermediate/advanced Rust features are used to create the game.  

All assets and code were created by LogicProjects and are free to use in any way without restriction.
